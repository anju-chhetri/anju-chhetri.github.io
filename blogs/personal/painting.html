            It was during our organization's outing on January 27, 2025, that I first picked up a paintbrush—not literally, but with the genuine intent to paint.
            A month later, on February 27, 2025, after an intense month of work and finally submitting my research for its first peer review, I found myself completely drained.

            In that tired moment, I decided to take up a hobby—painting.
            
            All of my paintings from day 1 are displayed in reverse chronological order. The first one? My roommate at the hostel jokingly called it "a flag of Germany."

        What I’ve come to realize that painting is one of the best teachers of calmness and patience.
        While it’s tempting to rush and see the final picture, it’s crucial to remain calm and patient.
        When we don’t follow this, painting gives instant feedback: a wrong brush stroke or color mix can easily ruin the picture.
        What I’ve also come to respect about painting is that it doesn’t just show the consequences of impatience—it also gives us the opportunity to work through our mistakes, let the paint dry, and rework  it.
