After months of staying home, I finally set out on a new journey.
Though the purpose was not for leisure, it turned out to be just what I needed.
This trip to New Delhi, India, was for my visa interview. But travel often gives us more than we expect.
What started as an official visit slowly transformed into a refreshing escape, filled with new places, new faces, and many little surprises along the way.
<br> <br>
The journey began with a long bus ride of around sixteen hours.
As we neared Delhi, the landscape began to change in striking ways.
What caught my attention first was Noida. The tall buildings, broad roads, and clean structure gave a sense of organized development.
I later learned it is known as the city of universities, which made perfect sense.
And just before that, we passed through the mango jungles of Uttar Pradesh. Endless stretches of green fields and mango trees made it one of the most fertile and beautiful regions I had seen.
<br> <br>
Delhi itself welcomed me with a rush of movement and color.
The first thing I noticed was the incredible diversity. People from all backgrounds, dressed in so many different ways, speaking different languages.
This is not something I usually see back home in Nepal. It felt like the city was alive with a mix of cultures and experiences, each adding something unique to its energy.
<br> <br>
Prices, however, were a different kind of surprise.
Fruits and clothes were more expensive than I had imagined.
One moment that still makes me smile is when a fruit seller confidently told me, <i>"Yeh to Washington ke apples hain"</i> which means <i>"These are apples from Washington."</i>
Back home, people are more proud to say, <i>"Yeh toh India se aaya hain."</i>
I heard something similar from a corn seller who told me, <i>"Yeh America ka makkai hain."</i>
I think many people here see America as a symbol of quality and pride.

Beyond these light moments, something deeper stood out.
The contrast in living standards was hard to ignore.
I saw people driving luxury cars and shopping in glass buildings while just across the road, others were sleeping on footpaths.
Seeing both sides of this reality so closely was eye opening and made me reflect on how much can exist side by side in a single city.
<br> <br>
During my short stay, I made sure to explore a few iconic spots.
I visited India Gate, spent some peaceful time at Ashramdhan Temple, and had my first experience riding the Delhi Metro.
The metro system was clean, fast, and well connected, and I was genuinely impressed.
I also explored the Central Market, which was full of life, colors, and endless noise.
The food was a big part of the trip too.
Afghani dishes quickly became my favorite, and I kept going back for more throughout my stay.
<br> <br>
This was not a planned vacation, but it became a journey I will remember for a long time.
Delhi surprised me in so many ways. It gave me a fresh perspective, a break from routine, and a collection of moments that felt real and unforgettable.
I came back not just with a visa but with stories, experiences, and a heart full of snapshots from a city that never stays still.
