            <h1>Arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina</h1>
                My journey to <b>Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina</b>, marked my first Europe trip — and it brought with it a mix of excitement and anxiety.
                I arrived around 1:20 PM and reached the hotel by 2:15 PM, accompanied by three fellow participants from Denmark, Sweden, and Amsterdam.
                <br>
                Being in Europe for the first time, surrounded by people from different cultures, felt both fascinating and overwhelming.
                But I realized that much of the anxiety was internal. I chose not to go for a late-night walk that evening — a small decision that helped me feel more in control and confident in myself.
                I reminded myself that it was okay to take time to adjust.
                <br><br>

                <b>Day 1: </b>On the first day, my roommate Linn and I visited <b>Baščaršija</b>, Sarajevo’s old town.
                It was small but filled with character and history. We tried the famous Bosnian coffee, which was quite strong for my taste.

                <br>
                While walking through the town, we noticed a hill and decided to hike up.
                It led us to a <b>cemetery</b>, a reminder of Sarajevo’s past — cemeteries are quite common throughout the city.
                From the hill, we had a beautiful panoramic view of Sarajevo: red rooftops and scattered tall buildings.
                
                <br>
                Later, we tried the popular Balkan dish <b>Ćevapi (Ćevapčići)</b>. Even the smallest portion felt huge to me! In the evening, I went to the cable car with some friends. We took it one way and hiked back down along the old Olympic track.
                There were apple trees on the way, which somehow left a lasting impression. It was a great day, thanks to the people I was with.

                <br><br>
                <b>Day 1: </b>I met many participants today and made a good friend from the UK.
                It was a bit overwhelming — meeting people from 43 different countries all at once.
                With my soft voice, which can be hard to hear in noisy environments, and the lingering travel anxiety, I felt a bit on edge. But I kept listening to the positive voice inside me, and that helped me get through the day.
                <br><br>

                <b>Day 3: </b> By the second day of lectures, I started feeling more comfortable.
                I wasn’t afraid to be alone or initiate conversations.
                During lab sessions, I had a small fan moment when I spoke with Arthur Conmy, an expert in mechanistic interpretability.

                <br> Later, I presented my poster. It was challenging to speak over the noise, but I managed.
                Arthur visited my poster and gave some helpful feedback — and yes, I took a photo with him, which felt like one of the highlights of the week.
                By the end of the day, I felt more connected with the participants around me.
                I wasn’t trying too hard; I was simply enjoying being part of it all.


                <br><br>

                <b>Day 4: </b> This day featured a session by <b>Aaron Courville</b>.
                What struck me most was how involved he was — not only as a speaker but also as a listener.
                He attended other sessions, asked questions, and seemed genuinely excited to learn.
                Seeing that kind of enthusiasm from someone so experienced made me realize the importance of staying curious and grounded.
                It was a reminder that learning truly never stops. By now, I felt comfortable and confident in my own space.

                <br><br>
                <b>Day 5</b> This was an exciting day with a city tour and a break from regular sessions.
                I learned about venture capital — specifically, what makes a startup stand out: being truly different, having the right team, and being defensible.

                <br>
                We visited the <b>Tunnel of Hope</b>, a place I had really wanted to see.
                The city tour continued under the intense heat, so I took a short break before heading to the Jane Street event.
                Initially, I was unsure about participating — I didn’t feel "ready." But I’m glad I did.
                I ended up actively contributing, and our team placed fifth, which felt encouraging.
                Later, I joined others for a casual drinks session.
                I don’t drink, but I enjoyed the conversation — people were talking about <b>machine learning, Andrej Karpathy, Demis Hassabis</b> — and I felt like I belonged there.
                We ended the day with a walk to the city center and ice cream.
                Mine was a bit too sweet, but it was a lovely way to wrap up a long day.

                <br><br>

                <b>Day 6: </b> The day began with a lecture by <b>Samy Bengio</b>.
                Around mid-morning, I took my <b>TUM aptitude test</b> — I was a bit worried it would be stressful, but surprisingly, it wasn’t.
                I still felt okay afterward.

                <br><br>
                Later in the evening, we had a gala dinner, and one of my most memorable moments was the walk back to the hotel from the hills — even at 10 or 11 PM, it felt safe.
                That sense of freedom and security was refreshing.

                <br><br>
                <b> Final Day: </b>The last day included final lectures, project demonstrations, and the official closing.
                Afterward, I went for another cable car ride. As my UK friend was about to miss her flight we had to walk back down due to a weather delay.
                I joined her, and on the way, we met some Russian participants.
                One of them invited me to join their group for dinner.
                Initially, I didn’t know what to expect, but it turned out to be a great experience.
                They were welcoming and kind, and I had meaningful conversations that stayed with me.
                It reminded me how much there is to learn from different cultures.

                <h1>The Journey Home and Looking Back</h1>

                As I write this from the plane, which is delayed due to air traffic, I finally have some time to reflect.
                <br>                
                Coming from Nepal to Bosnia felt like a big step. Yes, I received a travel grant, but I also had to gather the courage to take that step.
                I remember how the cultural differences initially felt overwhelming. I wasn’t confident in my English, and I realized I had a softer voice compared to others, I had to speak louder to be heard.

                <br>
                Many conversations were about countries people had visited, which is common in Europe but unfamiliar to me.
                At times, I felt disconnected but a voice in my head kept repeating: "If you stay in a corner, no one will come talk to you.
                You have to go out and talk to them." These were words from the ambassador, and they helped me through those moments.

                <br><br>
                Gradually, I opened up. I didn't always share my thoughts, but I listened and learned. I saw how passionate and cognitively active people were.
                Seeing Aron Courville ask questions like any other student made me realize that people at the top of their fields never stop learning.                
                I also noticed how informal and approachable the organizers were. The environment was professional but relaxed, no unnecessary hierarchy.
                Whether I was talking to a PhD student or an undergraduate, the conversations felt equal and open.
                <br><br>
                One thing that stood out: feeling safe. People here could walk late at night without worry.
                I wish this kind of safety was a reality everywhere, it shouldn’t be a privilege, but a right.
                I also appreciated the freedom of dressing how I wanted without uncomfortable stares.
                
                <br><br>
                There was a sense of mutual respect and curiosity that made it easy to connect with people from all backgrounds.
                I met people from Sweden, the UK, Russia, Amsterdam, Finland, Vienna, Serbia, Ukraine, Germany, Romania, Albania, Peru, and more. It was enriching.
                Saying goodbye wasn’t sad, but there was a strange feeling knowing I might never meet many of these amazing people again. They were part of this brief, meaningful chapter.
