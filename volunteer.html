        <i> Date: 26th November,2023 - 29th November, 2023 </i><br>
         <p> Our team of 13 students visited the eastern-most part of Nepal with the aim of 
          raising awareness on essential subjects such as hardware, software, and crucial topics like 
          internet safety and cybercrime. It was an initiative
          to address the technology gap faced by rural students. During our visit, we covered two states, 
          Koshi and Madesh Pradesh, spanning across five districts: Dharan, Biratnagar, Itahari, Inaruwa, 
          and Janakpur, where we engaged with a total of 13 schools.</p>
          <p>We had the opportunity to meet hundreds of students and we were truly captivated by their eagerness
             to learn and their excitement upon discovering new technologies.
            However, the disparity in knowledge due to factors such as geographical placement,
            culture, and economic conditions was also an eye-opening experience. 
            This effort was a sincere attempt to contribute to and uplift our community.  </p>

        <i> Date: 17th December, 2023</i><br>
        <p>I had the opportunity of being the <b>session leader</b> for the first paper reading event
         hosted by <b>IEEE</b> at Pulchowk Campus. 
         The session itself was designed with two main focuses. 
         Firstly, we delved into the techniques and tips for effectively 
         reading a research paper. This part aimed to equip participants with 
         the skills needed to navigate through scholarly articles.</p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we dedicated a portion of the session to a thorough discussion of a 
          specific paper titled  <b>'Raising the Cost of Malicious AI-Powered Image Editing'</b>.
          This involved analyzing and talking about the content, findings, and implications of the paper. 
          Overall, it was an opportunity to foster a deeper understanding of both the general approach 
          to reading academic papers and the specific insights provided by the chosen paper on 
          AI-powered image editing  
        </p>
