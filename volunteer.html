            The discussion centered on how data analytics is transforming decision-making, accelerating innovation, and strengthening Nepal’s digital infrastructure.

            We were joined by an incredible lineup of panelists: <b>Mr. Kailash Badu</b> (Vice President of Products, <a href="https://www.genesesolution.com/" target="_blank"> Genese Solution</a>), <b>Dr. Suresh Manandhar</b> (CEO, Chief Scientist, and Co-founder, <a href="https://wiseyak.com/ " target="_blank">Wiseyak</a>), <b>Ms. Sweta Karna</b> (Vice President of Data, <a href="https://www.cedargate.com/" target="_blank">Cedar Gate Services</a>), and <b>Mr. Suresh Gautam</b> (CEO and Co-founder, <a href="https://www.extensodata.com/" target="_blank">eXtenso Data</a>).
            Given the diverse expertise of the panelists, I structured the session with one-to-one questions covering topics such as startups, global best practices, government policies, data privacy, and more.
            <br><br>
            This was my first experience moderating an event. Admittedly, I felt a wave of stage stress at first—questioning why I had put myself in that situation. But as the discussion unfolded, it turned into an incredibly rewarding experience that answered that very question.            </p>

              I had the wonderful opportunity to serve as an instructor for a workshop on the fundamentals of Machine Learning for undergraduate female students. The event aimed to empower more women to pursue careers in the field of machine learning. It hosted around <b>50 participants</b> from nearly <b>10 different institutions</b> across Nepal and was organized by the <a href="https://www.locus.com.np/" target="_blank"><b>LOCUS 2025 team</b></a>.
            
              We were two instructors for the workshop, where I served as an instructor covering <b>exploratory data analysis (both theoretical and practical), the fundamentals of Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and AI ethics</b>. I volunteered for this session to inspire young women to pursue research, especially in Nepal, where even in our institution, considered the leading AI research institute in the country, there are only two female research assistants.

              I served as an <b>AI facilitator</b> at the provincial-level training camp, <b>Right to Information

              The primary goal of the program was to enhance digital literacy among Nepali journalists. The event brought together
              50 journalists from six districts in the Madhesh Province, organized at two different districts, with nearly equal representation of both
              male and female participants.

              During the training, I facilitated the AI sessions, providing foundational knowledge of AI and demonstrating
              how journalists in Nepal can leverage this technology to improve their productivity. This included hands-on training with
              tools like <b>ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Claude</b>, as well as instruction on AI safety practices. Participants seemed to be highly interested in
              using ChatGPT's voice control in Nepali language and the image generation process. This experience not only revealed the significant digital divide in Nepal but also
              highlighted the eagerness of local journalists to adapt to new technologies despite infrastructure challenges.

            reading a research paper. This part aimed to equip participants with 
            the skills needed to navigate through scholarly articles.</p>
           <p>
             Secondly, we dedicated a portion of the session to a thorough discussion of a 
             specific paper titled  <b>'Raising the Cost of Malicious AI-Powered Image Editing'</b>.
             This involved analyzing and talking about the content, findings, and implications of the paper. 
             Overall, it was an opportunity to foster a deeper understanding of both the general approach 
             to reading academic papers and the specific insights provided by the chosen paper on 
             AI-powered image editing

        knowledge and practical application. The students were primarily freshmen and sophomores, numbered 40 in total, eager 
        to dive into the world of robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout the workshop, we engaged in 
        hands-on projects that allowed students to apply what they had learned in real-time. The camp included activities ranging 
        from LED blinking on a breadboard to exploring the incredible capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040).  We also worked with sensors 
        like the MPU-6050 and ultrasonic sensors. One of the 
        highlights was guiding the participants in designing and building a self-balancing robot.

          During the summer break of 2022, my friends from the <b>Robotics Club</b> and I organized a four-day robotics training camp at 
          <b>Milestone School</b>. This camp was designed for elementary school students and 
          aimed to encourage participation in robotics and STEM from a young age. It was more 
          of an awareness program, intended to spark interest and curiosity in these fields among young students.        
        </p>
        <p>
          The camp was conducted at a school where students came from low-income families. 
          Our goal was to provide these students with exposure to robotics and technology, 
          which they might not have had access to otherwise. The sessions began with simple explanations of fundamental concepts. 
          For instance, we described what <i>V=IR</i> means by giving an analogy of a ball rolling down a hill, 
          making it easier for the young students to grasp. We also engaged them in hands-on projects, such as 
          making a buzzer that buzzes when the water level rises, demonstrated using small water cups.This initiative 
          was a small step towards bridging the 
          gap in STEM education for underprivileged children and promoting inclusivity in these fields.
