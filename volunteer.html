              I served as an <b>AI facilitator</b> at the provincial-level training camp, <b>Right to Information
              Training Camp</b>, held in Janakpur and Siraha. This program was organized by <b>Sancharika Samuha</b>
              in collaboration with the <b>National Information Commission</b> and supported by <b>The Asia Foundation/USAID Nepal</b>.
              The primary goal of the program was to enhance digital literacy among Nepali journalists. The event brought together
              50 journalists from six districts in the Madhesh Province, organized at two different districts, with nearly equal representation of both
              male and female participants.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the training, I facilitated the AI sessions, providing foundational knowledge of AI and demonstrating
              how journalists in Nepal can leverage this technology to improve their productivity. This included hands-on training with
              tools like <b>ChatGPT, DALLÂ·E, and Claude</b>, as well as instruction on AI safety practices. Participants seemed to be highly interested in
              using ChatGPT's voice control in Nepali language and the image generation process. This experience not only revealed the significant digital divide in Nepal but also
              highlighted the eagerness of local journalists to adapt to new technologies despite infrastructure challenges.

            I had the honor of being invited to deliver an alumni speech at the orientation 
            program of the <b>Robotics Club</b> at Pulchowk Campus. I was an active member of the Robotics Club 
            from my freshman year through my junior year. This event was primarily aimed at freshmen, 
            where I was asked to share my personal experiences, insights, and advice as a former member.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my speech, I focused on how my involvement with the Robotics Club 
            enriched my undergraduate journey. I offered guidance on how new students can 
            maximize their time and opportunities within the club, drawing from my personal 
            experiences and the skills I gained over the years. Additionally, I had the opportunity 
            to engage in one-on-one interactions with freshmen and connect with them on a more personal level.        </p>

        <p>I had the opportunity of being the <b>session leader</b> for the first paper reading event
         hosted by <b>IEEE</b> at Pulchowk Campus. 
         The session itself was designed with two main focuses. 
         Firstly, we delved into the techniques and tips for effectively 
         reading a research paper. This part aimed to equip participants with 
         the skills needed to navigate through scholarly articles.</p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we dedicated a portion of the session to a thorough discussion of a 
          specific paper titled  <b>'Raising the Cost of Malicious AI-Powered Image Editing'</b>.
          This involved analyzing and talking about the content, findings, and implications of the paper. 
          Overall, it was an opportunity to foster a deeper understanding of both the general approach 
          to reading academic papers and the specific insights provided by the chosen paper on 
          AI-powered image editing

         <p> Our team of 13 students visited the eastern-most part of Nepal with the aim of 
          raising awareness on essential subjects such as hardware, software, and crucial topics like 
          internet safety and cybercrime. It was an initiative
          to address the technology gap faced by rural students. During our visit, we covered two states, 
          Koshi and Madesh Pradesh, spanning across five districts: Dharan, Biratnagar, Itahari, Inaruwa, 
          and Janakpur, where we engaged with a total of 13 schools.</p>
          <p>We had the opportunity to meet hundreds of students and we were truly captivated by their eagerness
             to learn and their excitement upon discovering new technologies.
            However, the disparity in knowledge due to factors such as geographical placement,
            culture, and economic conditions was also an eye-opening experience. 
            This effort was a sincere attempt to contribute to and uplift our community.  </p>

        I was an instructor at a four-day Robocamp, organized by the <b>Robotics Club, Pulchowk Campus</b>. This 
        workshop covered a wide range of topics, from basic electronic components like transistors 
        to more advanced concepts involving microcontrollers. The goal of Robocamp was to provide an introductory session that combined both theoretical 
        knowledge and practical application. The students were primarily freshmen and sophomores, numbered 40 in total, eager 
        to dive into the world of robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout the workshop, we engaged in 
        hands-on projects that allowed students to apply what they had learned in real-time. The camp included activities ranging 
        from LED blinking on a breadboard to exploring the incredible capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040).  We also worked with sensors 
        like the MPU-6050 and ultrasonic sensors. One of the 
        highlights was guiding the participants in designing and building a self-balancing robot.

          During the summer break of 2022, my friends from the <b>Robotics Club</b> and I organized a four-day robotics training camp at 
          <b>Milestone School</b>. This camp was designed for elementary school students and 
          aimed to encourage participation in robotics and STEM from a young age. It was more 
          of an awareness program, intended to spark interest and curiosity in these fields among young students.        
        </p>
        <p>
          The camp was conducted at a school where students came from low-income families. 
          Our goal was to provide these students with exposure to robotics and technology, 
          which they might not have had access to otherwise. The sessions began with simple explanations of fundamental concepts. 
          For instance, we described what <i>V=IR</i> means by giving an analogy of a ball rolling down a hill, 
          making it easier for the young students to grasp. We also engaged them in hands-on projects, such as 
          making a buzzer that buzzes when the water level rises, demonstrated using small water cups.This initiative 
          was a small step towards bridging the 
          gap in STEM education for underprivileged children and promoting inclusivity in these fields.
